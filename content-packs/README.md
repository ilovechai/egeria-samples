# Egeria Content Packs

The Egeria content packs provide a means to distribute standard metadata to different organizations.
They are formatted as [Open Metadata Archives](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/open-metadata-archive)
and can be loaded using the Administration Services
[at server start up](https://egeria-project.org/guides/admin/servers/configuring-the-startup-archives)
or [while the server is running](https://egeria-project.org/guides/operations/adding-archive-to-running-server).

They are build from archive writers in the [Sample Metadata Archives](../sample-metadata-archives) module.
